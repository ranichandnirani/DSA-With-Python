                                                Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, beginner-friendly programming language used for web apps, data science, AI, automation, and more.

It is:-
1. Interpreted
2. High Level
3. Object-oriented
4. Extensive libraries
5. Beginner-friendly

Why Python is popular?
--> Easy to read and write
--> Large community and libraries
--> Works on Windows, Mac, Linux
--> Good for both beginners and professionals     

What is Variables/Keywords/Identifiers/Comments?
1. Variables:-
        A variable is a named container that stores data in memory.
        name = "Alice"      (string variable)
        age = 25            (integer variable)
        price = 99.99       (float variable)
        is_active = True    (boolean variable)


Key rules:-
- No need to declare type — (Python is dynamically typed)
- You can reassign a variable to a different type anytime

2. Keywords:-
        Keywords are reserved words that have special meaning in Python. You cannot use them as variable names.
        for ex-
            if, elif, else, break, for, def, import etc...

3. Identifiers:-
        An identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module, etc.
Rules:
1. Can contain letters (a–z, A–Z), digits (0–9), and underscores _
2. Cannot start with a digit → 2name ❌, name2 ✅
3. Case-sensitive → Age and age are different
4. Cannot be a keyword → class = 5 ❌            
Valid identifiers:
        my_variable = 10
        _private = 20
        CamelCase = 30
        value1 = 40

4. Comments:-
        Comments are lines ignored by the Python interpreter — used to explain code.
        1. Single-line comment → use #
        2. Multi-line comment ->use '''---'''
