                                                Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, beginner-friendly programming language used for web apps, data science, AI, automation, and more.

It is:-
1. Interpreted
2. High Level
3. Object-oriented
4. Extensive libraries
5. Beginner-friendly

Why Python is popular?
--> Easy to read and write
--> Large community and libraries
--> Works on Windows, Mac, Linux
--> Good for both beginners and professionals     

What is Variables/Keywords/Identifiers/Comments?
1. Variables:-
        A variable is a named container that stores data in memory.
        name = "Alice"      (string variable)
        age = 25            (integer variable)
        price = 99.99       (float variable)
        is_active = True    (boolean variable)


Key rules:-
- No need to declare type — (Python is dynamically typed)
- You can reassign a variable to a different type anytime

2. Keywords:-
        Keywords are reserved words that have special meaning in Python. You cannot use them as variable names.
        for ex-
            if, elif, else, break, for, def, import etc...

3. Identifiers:-
        An identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module, etc.
Rules:
1. Can contain letters (a–z, A–Z), digits (0–9), and underscores _
2. Cannot start with a digit → 2name ❌, name2 ✅
3. Case-sensitive → Age and age are different
4. Cannot be a keyword → class = 5 ❌            
Valid identifiers:
        my_variable = 10
        _private = 20
        CamelCase = 30
        value1 = 40

4. Comments:-
        Comments are lines ignored by the Python interpreter — used to explain code.
        1. Single-line comment → use #
        2. Multi-line comment ->use '''---'''

5. Operators:-
        1). Arithmetic Operators:
                        Used for mathematical calculation.
                                a)- +(Addithion) 
                                        ex: print(5 + 3)
                                b)- -(Subtraction)
                                        ex: print(5 - 3)
                                c)- *(Multiplication)
                                        ex: print(5 * 3)
                                d)- /(Division)
                                        ex: print(34/2) decemale
                                e)- //(Floor division)
                                        ex: print(34//2) return output is floor value (integer)
                                f)- %(Modulo)
                                        ex: print(34%3)
                                g)- **(Exponentiation)
                                        ex: print(2**3) power
        2). Assignment Operators:
                        Used to assign values to Variables.
                                a)- =(Assign) 
                                        ex: a = 10                               
                                b)- +=(Add and assign)
                                        ex: a += 2
                                c)- -=(Subtract and assign)
                                        ex: a -= 2
                                d)- *=(Multiply and assign)
                                        ex: a *= 3
                                e)- etc..
        3). Comparison Operators:
                        Used to compare values.
                                a)- ==(Equal to)                        
                                b)- !=(Not equal to)
                                c)- >(Greater than)
                                d)- <(Less than)
                                e)- >=(Greater than equal to)
                                f)- <=(Less than equal to)
        4). Logical Operators:
                        Used to combine conditional statements.
                                a)- &&(Logical AND)                        
                                b)- ||(Logical OR)
                                c)- !(Logical NOT)
        5). Bitwise Operators:
                        Used to manipulate individual bits of data.
                                a)- &(Bitwise AND)
                                b)- |(Bitwise OR)
                                c)- ^(Bitwise XOR)
                                d)- ~(Bitwise NOT)
                                e)- <<(Left shift)
                                f)- >>(Right shift)
        6). Identity Operators:                        
                        Used to compare memory locations of objects.
                                a)- is(Return True if both variables are the same object).
                                b)- is not(Returns True if both variables are not the same object).
        7). Membership Operators:
                        Used to chack if a value is part of a sequence.
                                a)- in(Returns True if a value is found in the sequence).
                                b)- not in(Returns True if a value is not found in the sequence).
6. Data Types:-
        Data types are used to represent the type of a variable. They tell the Python interpreter what operation can be performed on various types of data.
                        a)- Primitive (Numaric(int, bool, float, complex), String(str), Boolean(bool))
                        b)- Collection (List, Tuple, Set, Dictionary)
                        c)- Speciale(None)
